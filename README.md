# commtap_eye_gaze
Eye gaze communication using javascript.
This is an experimental project looking at having cells on a web page that can be triggered using an eye gaze device. I.e. the main requirement is that a cell will trigger if a mouse is within the cell for more than a specified amount of time. A re-activation delay can also be specified to reduce unintentional re-triggering of a cell.
