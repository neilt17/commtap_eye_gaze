<a href="/test-eg2016-files/display.php">Go straight to the AAC page sets</a>

<h2>Explanation, background</h2>
The purpose of this is to:
<ul>
<li>be able to create specifically eye gaze communication pages (it will be adaptable for click/tap access and also for switches);</li>
<li>be able to view the communication pages and page sets without any specialist software - i.e. in a browser;</li>
<li>be able to save communication pages and page sets onto any computer and be able to use them - even if the original software for making them has gone, and without needing any internet connection;</li>
<li>it would be possible to edit the pages without any specialist software as well - HTML could be edited directly;</li>
<li>allow us to create communication pages specifically for the children we work with, having the features that is useful for them.</li>
</ul>

<h3>So far</h3>
Some sample communication pages have been made. These demonstrate:
<ul>
<li>A visible dwell timer on pages - dwell time is configurable; the dwell image could also be configurable;</li>
<li>The dwell timer starts when the mouse enters a cell (or user gazes into the cell), and stops when either the mouse leaves the cell or the timer reaches the activation time;</li>
<li>On reaching the activation time, the following actions have been configured:</li>
<ul>
<li>A message is played;</li>
<li>or, you are directed to another page (a message is played when the new page is loaded);</li>
<li>Automatic creation of AAC pages when sound/text/image files are placed in particular directories.</li>
</ul>
<li>After a message is played, a cell can be re-triggered (speak again) if the user gazes away from the cell and then back into it, or, after a configurable delay, if they move their gaze a little within the cell.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Voices</h3>
Uses eSpeak voices - can be scripted server side, saved into WAV files and converted again (using LAME) into mp3 files. mp3 is theoretically compatible with more browsers - allegedly all - though this may depend on the OS. See also below.

<h3>Symbols</h3>
opensymbols.org has an api for searching a number of Creative Commons licensed symbols databases. Many of the symbols that this returns are not for commercial use - which could present a problem if we wanted to charge for access or if this is part of an offering of a subscription access site.


<h3>Browser compatibility</h3>
The pages use HTML5 for:
* creating the dwell timer image;
* playing the audio;

There is no problem with the timer image for HTML5 compatible browsers - should work for all modern browsers;

The &lt;audio&gt; element is implemented in modern browsers, however on mobile devices, only a click action can lead to audio being played - mouse moving in or out of a cell will not work. As eye gaze systems currently only interact with Windows tablets/PCs this is not really a problem. If these AAC pages are to be used on mobile then the mouse access setting should be enabled.

<h3>Technical</h3>
<h4>Creating sound on mac</h4>
* Set up on local mac (not generally available): findsymbol "notes" - finds
symbol and converts to png in current directory
* Convert emf to png using LibreOffice:
/Applications/LibreOffice.app/Contents/MacOS/soffice --headless --convert-to png "/Users/Fred/Documents/Symbols/list.emf"
* Using speak on mac (similar to espeak on linux):
speak -venglish_rp -p90 "spinning patterns" -wspinning_patterns.wav

<h4>Adding pages</h4>

<b>This applies only if you have access to files on the server.</b>

This is a rough and ready way for creating pages for test purposes.

Page sets are contained in the "boards" directory, each directory within this directory is a page set. A page set contains a set of directories which correspond to cells on a page: each cell within this directory has its own directory. The cell directories are named as follows: &gt;row-index>,&gt;column-index>-&gt;label>. The cell directory contains the following files: "display[.EXTENSION]" - contains the text to display; "sound|audio[.EXTENSION]" - the sound file to play; "image[.EXTENSION]" - the image to show.
